          <p>Dogs may be man's best friend, but new research on ancient canine remains shows that
             the relationship didn't develop overnight. For long periods of time, humans lived in
             tension with their canine companions, often eating them and skinning them for pelts. 
             Theirs was a relationship of necessity and convenience.As the diet and lifestyle of
             humans shifted between the Middle and Late Stone Age, when dogs had already been 
             domesticated, those of their dogs shifted right along with them.Dogs are loyal,
             friendly and they provide protection for man</p>
